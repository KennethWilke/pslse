# This example Makefile is used to build an application using the libcxl
# archive library (libcxl.a) file.  This means your code is statically linked
# to the libcxl library.  Any changes to the libcxl library, such as moving
# to the hardware libcxl library, will require a full recompile of your code.
# The advantage to this method is that you do not need to set any envrionment
# variables for your executable to run.
