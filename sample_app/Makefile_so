# This example Makefile is used to build an application using the libcxl
# shared object file (libcxl.so) file.  This means your code is dynamically
# linked at runtime.  If building with this you will need to modify the
# environment variable LD_LIBRARY_PATH to include the directory containing
# libcxl.so before running your application.  The advantage to this method is
# that is the libcxl library ever changes, such as moving to the hardware
# libcxl library, no recompile of your application code is neccessary.
