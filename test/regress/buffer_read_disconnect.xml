<!-- The test in this suite generates read & write activity for all AFU
     machines then abrupted calls cxl_afu_free after a few seconds without
     properly shutting down the AFU machines.  It is intended to interrupt
     commands in mid-flight.  The test is run multiple times to ensure that
     pslse handles the cases that can arise in this scenario smoothly and
     continue to handle additional applications.  WARNING are allowed from
     pslse in this case as they are expected due to the mid-command client
     drop.  The parameters for pslse are selected to have as much activity
     going on and not have commands stalled for reordering. -->
